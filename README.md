# MedScanApp

Project is submission for PoweringSTEM Hackathon 
 - Team: Gaurish Agrawal, Aniket Gupta, Aahan Patel, Kabir Rakshe
 
 - When paramedics arrive on the scene to save an injured person, they often don't have their medical history on file or can't be accessed at that moment. In these crucial moments on the way to the hospital, every second matters to treat the patient. Paramedics can only do so much without knowing the patient's medical information. With MedScan, paramedics can scan their faces to bring up necessary information from the patient's medical history, such as age, emergency contacts, diagnosed diseases, and more. 

Before running the project for the first time, make sure to clear the database and delete everything in the faces/uploads folder and the pkl file.
